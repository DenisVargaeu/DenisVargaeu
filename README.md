# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi! My name is Denis, and Iâ€™m a young programmer.
Since I was a kid, technology has fascinated me, and today I focus on creating websites, applications, and various Raspberry Pi projects. I enjoy programming in languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, and Iâ€™m gradually improving my skills in Python.

Besides programming, Iâ€™m creative and curious â€“ I love trying new things, such as creating my own operating system, antivirus, or web games. I also spend my free time working on projects that combine my imagination, like vacation maps, mathematical applications, or different tycoon games.

On my Raspberry Pi devices, the LED always blinks because every project should shine just like my ideas! ðŸ˜„

Currently, Iâ€™m working on my own operating system called `ProgOS`, which is focused on programming and learning. It will support FTP, MySQL, and many other developer tools. The goal is to make it run on both Raspberry Pi and regular computers with minimal requirements.

My dream is to keep improving, learning new things, and one day creating something big that will help others.
